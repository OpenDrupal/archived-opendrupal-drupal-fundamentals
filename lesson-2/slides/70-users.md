# Exercise
As an editor, I want to have all the rights that belong to my job as an editor.

- Check the permissions of the editor role.
- Adjust if you think it is necessary.
- Test the role with the editor account. Can the editor do too little or too much?

# Exercise
As administrator of the website, I want to have all the rights to manage the site and the users.

- Create a role 'Site manager' and assign the necessary permissions to it.
- Test the user management with a test account.
- Check that the permissions are set safely. Can the site manager not do too much?
