# Prepair as trainer
Attendees need a working Drupal 8 site to perform the exercises. You as a trainer need one too to demonstrate Drupal
and explain and demonstrate the exercises. 

## (Self) hosted
The trainer is advised to use a personal sandbox on a localhost server. For attendees there are roughly two options: On-line and provided by the trainer or Self hosted by the attendee on a localhost server. The choice depends on the
attendees abillity, or their company's, to install Drupal.

## Drupal installation
Use the latest stable Drupal release. Use the opendrupal_drupal_fundamentals installation profile that is included, and
copy it into the *profiles* directory. Install Drupal with this installation profile.
